## Problem

Query the two cities in **STATION** with the shortest and longest *CITY* names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.  
The **STATION** table is described as follows:

```db2

/*
    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
    3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.
*/

-- Query 1: Get the single shortest city name
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;

-- Query 2: Get the single longest city name
SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;

```
