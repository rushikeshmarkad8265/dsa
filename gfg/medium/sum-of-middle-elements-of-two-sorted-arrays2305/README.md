# Sum of Middle of two sorted arrays

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given two sorted integer arrays  **arr1[]**  and  **arr2[]** of the same size. Find the sum of the middle elements of two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 2, 4, 6], arr2[] = [4, 5, 6, 9]
Output: 9
Explanation: The merged array looks like [1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 9,]. Sum of middle elements is 9 (4 + 5).

```

```
Input: arr1[] = [1, 12, 15, 26, 38], arr2[] = [2, 13, 17, 30, 45]
Output: 32
Explanation: The merged array looks like [1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]. Sum of middle elements is 32 (15 + 17).
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr1.size() == arr2.size() ≤ 103
1 ≤ arr1[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr2[i] ≤ 106

```py
class Solution:
    def findMidSum(self, arr1, arr2):
        # code here
        i =0
        n = len(arr1)
        arr1 = arr1+arr2
        arr1.sort()
        return arr1[n-1]+arr1[n]
```
