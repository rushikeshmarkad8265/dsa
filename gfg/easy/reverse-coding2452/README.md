![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer  **n**, compute the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). If n is 0, the sum should be 0.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 6
Output: 21
Explanation: The sum of natural numbers up to 6 is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.
```

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: The sum of natural numbers up to 4 is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
```

```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Since n is 0, the sum is 0.
```

 **Constraints:** 
0 ≤ n ≤ 104
