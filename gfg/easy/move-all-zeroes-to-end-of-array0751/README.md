# Move All Zeroes to End

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array  **arr[]**  of non-negative integers. You have to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed  **in place**, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

```py
class Solution:
	def pushZerosToEnd(self, arr):
    	# code here
    	n = len(arr)
    	start = 0
    	end = n-1
    	zero = 0
        
        while(start < n):
            if arr[start]!=0:
                arr[start],arr[zero] =arr[zero],arr[start]
                start+=1
                zero+=1
            
            else:
                start+=1
                
                
```
